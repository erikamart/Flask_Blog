###### Flask Series NOTES ############

# Part 3 - Forms and User Input ->
# Install flask-wtf
# # ~$ pip install flask-wtf

# In forms.py, you are specifying forms to be used but you want to protect the application with a secret key. 
# A secret key will protect against modifying cookies, cross-site requests, forgery attacks, etc. To set this,
# open the routes.py file and right below the "from" imports add the line-> app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = ''
# To generate a good random set of characters, startup your python interpreter and use the built-in secrets module.
# # ~$ import secrets
# To get a big random set of characters, use the token hex method and pass in a 16 byte amount->
# # ~$ secrets.token_hex(16)
# Copy the character set and use it. (Note: in a later video this will be moved to an environment variable and put
# in the __init__.py file)

# Created the files login.html and register.html
