# Part 14 - Custom Domain Name for the Application ->
# The process of buying a domain name to host the application. Register a domain name from Namecheap.com. Search
# for a domain name that is available, add it to your cart, and click on "View Cart".

# @ 3:15. In the cart you will see offers/options on duration of purchase per year and WhoisGuard. WhoisGuard is
# recommended because it protects your privacy with buying a domain. You enter a lot of personal info when
# buying a domain and if you don't use some type of protection then that info is available to people who try to
# look you up. If you open your CLI in linux and type in the command whois and the name of the domain you want
# to know, it will list out all the info. ->
# # ~$ whois <domain>
# WhoisGuard blocks the most personal info parts and lists only the registering site (in this case, namecheap).

# @ 5:29. Pay Now for your domain order. You don't need all the other add-ons. The payment shouldn't be more
# than $10. Once purchased, navigate to the Domain List to view your newly owned domain name. 

# @ 6:15. Now go to the linode site. You'll see in the dashboard the linodes you've made. Go to the "Get Help"
# area and do a search for DNS Manager. Follow the link provided and view the documentation on how to set-up a
# domain name. The link is -> https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/
# Scroll down the page, you'll see the section "DNS Set-Up Checklist". You've done step 1; now on to step 2.

# @ 7:25. Click the link from step 2 and view the 5 linode server names. Copy them. Go to your Namecheap.com
# account and Paste the server names into your domain "Nameservers" area after clicking the "Manage" button for
# your domain. The linode server names are ->
# #     ns1.linode.com
# #     ns2.linode.com
# #     ns3.linode.com
# #     ns4.linode.com
# #     ns5.linode.com
# It will take a few hours for the change to take affect. While you're waiting you can move on to step 3.

# @ 10:03. Step 3 of the "DNS Set-Up Checklist" is add a domain, and then start adding some basic DNS records.
# Go back to the namecheap.com account and view the "Domains" area. There you will see a button to "Add a
# Domain"; click it. In the fields provided, fill in the info for Domain, email address, and optional tags.
# Click on create when done. 

# @ 11:38. Use the guide provided from the Linode site, below the checklist, to fill in the DNS records fields.
# You will be adding an "AAAA" record. Fill in the fields with the info of the flaskblog ip_servername.

# @ 13:45. Step 4, set the reverse DNS. The Linode site instructions may be outdated. Click on the section for
# "Linodes", then click on the "Networking" tab, and scroll down to the IPv4 section. Edit the "Reverse DNS" to
# be your domain name from namecheap. When you save you'll get an error. This is normal; changes take time to 
# take effect, about 15-30min. Once it works, test the website by navigating to it and clicking on the site to 
# verify functionality is good.
